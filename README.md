# Notes App Challenge – Ensolvers

## Overview

This project is a simple note-taking web application built as a Full Stack SPA.
It allows users to create, edit, archive, and manage notes, with proper error handling and logging.
Authentication is implemented with JWT tokens, and each request includes a Correlation ID for traceability.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|--------------|
| **Backend** | Java 21 · Spring Boot 3.3+ · JPA/Hibernate · PostgreSQL |
| **Frontend** | React (Vite) · Axios · React Router |
| **Authentication** | JWT (Spring Security) |
| **Logging** | Logback + MDC Correlation ID |

## Architecture

The system is divided into two independent apps:
- `/backend`: Spring Boot REST API
- `/frontend`: React SPA (Vite)

Detailed diagrams are available in the [`/docs`](./docs) folder:
- [Architecture Overview](./docs/architecture.md)
- [Data Model (ERD)](./docs/data-model.md)
- [Authentication Flow](./docs/auth-flow.md)
- [Logging and Correlation](./docs/logging.md)

## Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Maven 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL running locally

### Run

To start the application, run:

```bash
./start.sh
```

This script will:
- Create or migrate the database schema
- Run the Spring Boot backend
- Start the React frontend

Manual run:

```bash
cd backend && mvn spring-boot:run
```

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Authentication

Login with:

```
username: admin
password: admin123
```

## Logging Example

```
2025-11-11 11:32:14 INFO [d2f1c97e-21e3-42b6] NoteService – User admin created note "Shopping List"
```

## Deployment

## Future Improvements

These are potential next steps for scalability and maintainability:

- Replace JWT authentication with Keycloak for centralized identity management
- Add unit tests with JUnit and integration tests with RestAssured
- Implement Docker Compose for full local orchestration
